# Utilities

Utilities are commands or scripts, that could be written in any language.
They are used to execute specific functions we need within CI.

Examples of utilities are common bash scripts used across multiple builders, or programs to process data during builds.

The code here should be small and relatively self contained.
If its large it should be its own stand alone project.
