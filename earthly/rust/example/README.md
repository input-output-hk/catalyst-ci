# Example Rust Project

This is an simple but hopefully full featured example rust project.
It is used to test both our Catalyst-CI Rust building infrastructure and serve as a template for its use.

This code was originally sourced from: ["rust-starter](https://rust-starter.github.io/).
The code in this repo has been adapted for our needs.
