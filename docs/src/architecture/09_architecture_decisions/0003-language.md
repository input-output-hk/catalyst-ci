## Context

Any project contains a large amount of human readable text.
The team is multi-national and a common primary language needs to be chosen for the project.

## Assumptions

That everyone on the team will have a reasonable grasp of the primary language of the project.
That it will be reasonable to enforce the primary language on all team members contributions.

## Decision

After consultation with the existing team,
and considerations of the audience for the project the primary language of the project will be:

* US English

## Risks

* That people where English is not a primary language will have difficulty conforming to the requirement.

## Consequences

Having a uniform language for the project makes it easier for people to interact on a common basis.
