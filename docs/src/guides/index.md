# Guides

This section contains guides for using the Catalyst CI to perform common tasks.
If you're just getting started with Catalyst CI, these guides will prove useful for getting going as fast as possible.
Each guide contains a full reference `Earthfile` as well as step-by-step instructions for building it.

Most guides are broken down by a particular task.
The language section contains guides for getting started with a particular programming language.
If you don't see a guide, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-ci/issues) requesting
it.
Even better, open a PR that adds the guide!
