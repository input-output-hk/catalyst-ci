This guide will get you started with using the Catalyst CI to work with Python based projects.

To begin, clone the Catalyst CI repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-ci.git
```

Navigate to `examples/python` to find a basic Python project, with the `Earthfile` in it.
This is the `Earthfile` we will be building in this guide.
You can choose to either delete the file and start from scratch,
or read the guide and follow along in the file.
