# Spell Checking

## Introduction

checking is integrated into the `check` pipeline.
The reference to the pipeline can be found [here](https://input-output-hk.github.io/catalyst-ci/onboarding/).
The goal of the `check` stage is to ensure the overall health of the project.

This utilizes [`cspell`](https://cspell.org) under the hood for checking code and other text documents.
It can be used to check for misspelled words, identify potential errors, and suggest corrections.

## Using the spell checking

In an Earthfile in your repo, add the following:

```earthfile
check-spelling:
    DO github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-ci/earthly/cspell:<tag>+check-spelling
```

Executing `earthly +check-spelling` will automatically run the spell checking to all files in the repository.

### Run locally

```earthfile
spellcheck-lint:
    # Check spelling in this repo.
    LOCALLY

    DO github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-ci/earthly/cspell:t1.2.0+CSPELL_LOCALLY --src=$(echo ${PWD})
```

In this use case, the UDC is run Locally, so that the src in the repo can be directly checked.

## Configuration

Each repo will need a [`cspell.json`](https://cspell.org/configuration/) file in the root of the repo.
This file configures `cspell`.
The file provided in the `Catalyst-CI` repo should be taken as a starting point
for new projects.

## Adding specific words to documents

Words must ONLY be added to document words if they are correctly spelled.

### Project Words

It will be necessary for each project to have a list of custom words.
This list extends the list of valid words accepted by the spellchecker.

These words are added to the file:

```path
<repo root>/.config/dictionaries/project.dic
```

The path can also be configured in the `cspell.json` file.

```json
"dictionaryDefinitions": [
    {
        "name": "project-words",
        "path": ".config/dictionaries/project.dic",
        "description": "Words used in this project.",
        "addWords": true
    }
],
```

This can be necessary for the following reasons:

* The built-in dictionaries do not contain all possible valid words.
  * This is especially true when using names of Companies, Products or Technology.
* There are identifiers used in the code which are used which fail spell checks.

Words must ONLY be added to project words if they are correctly spelled.

Project words that are added MUST be included in any PR where they became necessary.
PR Review MUST check that the added words are both reasonable and valid.

Before a word is added to the project dictionary, it should be considered if it is a word likely to occur many times.

Some spelling errors may only occur once, or a handful of times.
Or, they may be an artifact of the code itself.
In these cases it is MUCH better to disable the spelling error inline rather than add a word to the project dictionary.
See [In Document Settings](http://cspell.org/configuration/document-settings/#in-document-settings) for details.

### Specific file patterns words

Custom words and dictionaries for specific file patterns can be configured inside `cspell.json` in the root of the repo.
This can be made by adding `overrides` with custom specifications for specific file patterns.

<!-- cspell: disable -->
```json
"overrides": [
    {
        "language": "es,es_ES",
        "filename": "**/*_es.arb",
        "dictionaries": [
            "es-es"
        ]
    },
    {
        "filename": "**/*.pbxproj",
        "allowCompoundWords": true,
        "words": [
            "iphoneos",
            "onone",
            "xcassets",
            "objc",
            "xcconfig",
            "lproj",
            "libc",
            "objc",
            "dsym"
        ]
    }
]
```
<!-- cspell: enable -->

### Inline specific words

It is possible to specify custom words within a file by adding comments.

```text
cspell: words <words>
```

Here are some examples for inlining:

* Comments on Earthfiles

```earthly
# cspell: words libgcc freetype lcms openjpeg etag 
```

* Comments on markdown files

```md
<!-- cspell: words healthcheck isready psql --> 
```

## Generated Files

Automatically generated files are likely to contain large amounts of spelling errors.
For these files/paths, exclude them from the spell check by adding their filenames to `"ignorePaths": []` in the `cspell.json` file.

## Editor Integration

`cspell` is integrated into VSCode and may be integrated into other Editors.

The editor integration should pick up the `cspell.json` configuration file and behave exactly the same as the Earthly UDC.
