# Introduction

Welcome to the Catalyst CI documentation!
The purpose of this documentation is to familiarize end-users with the various Project Catalyst CI processes.
Our team uses a specific subset of technologies to build and deliver our services.
It's critical to understand what those tools are and how they interact together in the CI process.

The quickest way to get started learning is by going through the [onboarding process](./onboarding/index.md).
For more in-depth documentation, please review the [reference section](./reference/index.md).
Before contributing to an `Earthfile`, please review the [style guide](./style.md).
If you want to learn how to build an `Earthfile` from scratch, check out the [available guides](./guides/index.md).
