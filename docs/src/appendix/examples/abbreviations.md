# Consistent Abbreviations

The HTML Specification is maintained by the W3C.

<!-- markdownlint-disable max-one-sentence-per-line -->

!!! note

    Abbreviations go in the `docs/includes/abbreviations.md` file.
    Except that doesn't work for some reason...
    So embed them like this at the end of a document:

    ```md
    *[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
    *[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium
    ```

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
